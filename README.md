## 📌 2. Student Performance Indicator  

## 📖 Overview
This project analyzes the factors affecting student performance and builds a regression model to predict test scores. The dataset includes demographic details and study-related variables.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- CatBoost, XGBoost  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🔍 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify impact of gender, ethnicity, parental education, and lunch type.  
- Preprocessing: feature scaling, encoding categorical features.  
- Feature engineering: total score, average score.  
- Trained multiple regression models; achieved **R² > 0.80** with CatBoost.  

## 📂 Dataset
- Kaggle dataset with 1000 students and 8 features.
